## Valgrind

How to debug with gdb under valgrind, read [valgrind manual](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core-adv.html#manual-core-adv.gdbserver-simple).

About startup parameters, read [valgrind cli](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.options).

Important cli options:

1. `--undef-value-errors=<yes|no> [default: yes]`, Controls whether Memcheck reports uses of undefined value errors. Set this to no if you don't want to see undefined value errors. It also has the side effect of speeding up Memcheck somewhat.
1. `--leak-check=<no|summary|yes|full> [default: summary]`, When enabled, search for memory leaks when the client program finishes. If set to summary, it says how many leaks occurred. If set to full or yes, each individual leak will be shown in detail and/or counted as an error, as specified by the options `--show-leak-kinds` and `--errors-for-leak-kinds`.
1. `--track-origins=<yes|no> [default: no]`, Controls whether Memcheck tracks the origin of uninitialised values. By default, it does not, which means that although it can tell you that an uninitialised value is being used in a dangerous way, it cannot tell you where the uninitialised value came from. This often makes it difficult to track down the root problem.
1. `--show-reachable=<yes|no> , --show-possibly-lost=<yes|no>`, to show the using memory.

## Linux: UTest

> Note: We use [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0) in `utest/gtest-fit`.

To make ST with utest and run it:

```bash
make linux-debug-utest && ./obj/st_utest
```

Note that the gcc(4.8) of CentOS is too old, please use docker(`ossrs/srs:dev-gcc7`) to run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/state-threads -w /state-threads \
    registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ossrs/srs:dev-gcc7 \
    bash -c 'make linux-debug-utest && ./obj/st_utest'
```

## Mac: UTest

> Note: We use [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0) in `utest/gtest-fit`.

To make ST with utest and run it:

```bash
make darwin-debug-utest && ./obj/st_utest
```

## Linux: Coverage

> Note: We use [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0) in `utest/gtest-fit`.

To make ST with utest and run it:

```bash
make linux-debug-gcov && ./obj/st_utest
```

Note that the gcc(4.8) of CentOS is too old, please use docker(`ossrs/srs:dev-gcc7`) to run:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/state-threads -w /state-threads \
    registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ossrs/srs:dev-gcc7 \
    bash -c 'make linux-debug-gcov && ./obj/st_utest'
```

Then, install [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/guide.html) for coverage:

```bash
yum install -y python2-pip &&
pip install lxml && pip install gcovr
```

Finally, run test and get the report:

```bash
bash auto/coverage.sh
```

## Mac: Coverage

> Note: We use [Google test](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0) in `utest/gtest-fit`.

To make ST with utest and run it:

```bash
make darwin-debug-gcov && ./obj/st_utest
```

## CLion

Use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) to open directory state-threads.

Then, open `ide/st_clion/CMakeLists.txt` and click `Load CMake project`.

Finally, select a configuration to run or debug.
